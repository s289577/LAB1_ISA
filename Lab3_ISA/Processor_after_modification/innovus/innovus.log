__/ message from Blocking QThread
**WARN: (PRL-280):	The elapsed time (33 sec) of the threaded job 1 is more than twice the CPU time (6 sec).  This indicates that enough physical memory is not available and the system may be swapping. It is recommended that you reduce the number of threads or jobs being run on this machine, or execute this job on a machine with a larger physical memory.
**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_parallel_arcs'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.

The in-memory database contained RC information but was not saved. To save 
the RC information, use saveDesign's -rc option. Note: Saving RC information can be quite large, 
so it should only be saved when it is really desired.
